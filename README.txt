Problem 1
1. login to csce.unl.edu, and go into the directory where the file is located. Compile it by typing (gcc sleepingStylistSem.c -pthread)
2. input (./a.out) to run the compiled program :)

Problem 2
1. similar to problem 1, but to compile, change the filename. Besides that, start with "gcc -c monitor.c", and then "gcc sleepingStylistMon.c monitor.o -pthread"
